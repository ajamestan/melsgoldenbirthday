    <h2>
      Hi, you made it to the end. I am sorry if this was an emotional journey, it
      definitely was for me. I was tearing up looking at so many of these photos
      and writing the captions. I hope you have the best birthday ever, and I cant
      wait to see you again soon.
      <br /><br />

      I want to make so many more memories with you, to keep growing with you,
      to connect and build a future together. I know that we have our hard days,
      but we also have the best days ever. I love you. I loved Seattle, and I
      loved being with you and your family. You are the most unique and special
      person I have ever met, and I am grateful for you every single day.
      <br /><br />

      I believe in you and in your dreams. I cant wait to see all the amazing
      things you will do in this world. You are going to change lives just by
      being you. You impact me and everyone around you more than you know.
      Everyone, especially me, is lucky to have you in their life.
      <br /><br />

      Happy Birthday Pea, Youre mine and im yours.
      <br /><br />
      With love, <br />
